# Who am I?

Hello! This is Junda. Currently I am a research engineer and PhD candidate from the Singapore Management University (SMU) under the supervision of Prof [David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/#:~:text=David%20Lo%20is%20a%20Professor,Analytics%20Research%20(SOAR)%20group.). My research interest lies on the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

Before I joined the [SOAR (SOftware Analytics Research) group](https://soarsmu.github.io/) of SMU, I studied computer science in the University College London (UCL) and graduated as a software developer.

<!-- Living in China, and lived in UK for nine years, now looking forward to new challenges. -->

<!-- # What is this website about?

I created this website as my personal blog for hosting my posts and thoughts. Since 21 Oct 2020, I will gradually
move my notes from [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) workspace to here.

The site is built with Jekyll and powered by Github pages. Klisé is minimalist Jekyll theme, for more information visit
Klisé theme at <a href="https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@github</a>.
You can [report](http://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise/issues/new) if there is an broken link(s) or somethings else. Notion is another tool that I would highly recommend for promoting productivity.


**Building a static website with Jekyll is nice and simple!**

Jekyll is largely adopted by Github and it triggers the trend of the static web development. With Jekyll, developers can build static websites in minutes, decorate it with a wide variety of themes and write blog posts in markdown. -->

# Why blogs?

Writing blogs is a perfect way to consolidate the knowledge. Most of the time, I forget to slow down and review my mistakes. The success of open-source software has proven that collaboration and sharing are the future development trend. I was hugely benefited by posts from other authors during my graduate and undergraduate career. It is my pleasure if my sharing could also benefit you, as a reader. At the same time, this is a great platform for us to know each other and make friends. I would incrementally improve this website and update new posts from now on. When using this website, don't hesitate to contact me if you noticed any issues or had any problems, I would try to get back you as soon as possible.
